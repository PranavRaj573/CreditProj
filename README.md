Overview:
This project focuses on credit card customer segmentation using clustering techniques. By grouping customers based on spending patterns and behaviors, the project aims to help businesses tailor services, predict trends, and enhance customer satisfaction.

The solution involves multiple stages, from data cleaning and scaling to visualization and the integration of a recommendation system. Advanced analytical techniques, such as anomaly detection and time series analysis, are employed for in-depth insights.

Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: Efficient numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms, including KMeans for clustering.
Plotly: Interactive visualizations for exploring and presenting results.
Tools Used
Google Colab: Cloud-based IDE for coding and collaboration.

The Project

Importing Libraries and Uploading a Dataset:
Setting up the environment with necessary libraries and uploading the dataset for analysis.

Reading the CSV File:
Loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame for manipulation and inspection.

Cleaning the Data:
Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preprocessing features.

Scaling the Data:
Normalizing numerical features using standard scaling techniques for clustering accuracy.

The KMeans Algorithm:
Applying KMeans to identify customer clusters based on spending patterns.

Using Plotly for Visualization:
Visualizing clusters and their distributions using interactive Plotly charts.

Results:

Clusters: Identified distinct customer groups with shared characteristics.
Graph Interpretation: Insights from cluster distributions, aiding in customer profiling.
